fortune-mod-buffy
=================

A fortune mod with quotes from Buffy the Vampire Slayer

Installation
------------

    git clone https://github.com/pattex/fortune-mod-buffy.git
    cd fortune-mod-buffy
    ./install.sh

Maybe you don't want to install the mod to the debian standard path. In that case you have to pass your path to the install script like:

    ./install.sh /path/to/fortunes

Confession-ish like thingy
--------------------------

It is possible that maybe somebody who looks a little like me took these quotes from here. Tanks a lot â€¦ he says.

I think I will extend this quotes with quotes from the Buffy comic books, some day.
