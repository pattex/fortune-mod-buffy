A fortune mod with quotes from Buffy the Vampire Slayer

Installation
------------

    git clone https://github.com/pattex/fortune-mod-buffy.git
    cd fortune-mod-buffy
    ./install.sh

Maybe you don't want to install the mod to the debian standard path. In that case you have to pass your path to the install script like:

    ./install.sh /path/to/fortunes

Usage
-----
Type:

    fortune buffy

Get something like:

    Buffy: Are you crazy? You just don't sneak up on people in a graveyard. You
      make noise when you walk, you stomp, or... yodel.

Again.

    fortune buffy
    Buffy: What do you want?
    Spike: I told you. I want to stop Angel. I want to save the world.
    Buffy: Okay, you do remember that you're a vampire, right?
    Spike: We like to talk big... vampires do. I'm going to destroy the world.
      That's just tough-guy talk. Strutting around with your friends over a
      pint of blood. The truth is, I _like_ this world. You've got...dog
      racing, Manchester United. And you've got people. Billions of people
      walking around like Happy Meals with legs. It's all right here. But then
      someone comes along with a vision. With a real... passion for
      destruction. Angel could pull it off. Good-bye, Picadilly. Farewell,
      Leicester-bloody-Square.

And again.

    fortune buffy
    Mayor Wilkins: There's more than one way to skin a cat. And I happen to
      know that factually that's true.

And again…

Confession like thingy on cpoyright-ish stuff
---------------------------------------------

It is possible that maybe somebody who looks a little like me took the first 281 quotes from [here](http://home.roadrunner.com/~computertaijutsu/buffy). Tanks a lot … he says.

I think I will extend this quotes with quotes from the Buffy comic books, some day.
