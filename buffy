Principal Snyder: It's fuzzy-minded liberal thinking like that that gets
  you eaten.
%
Cordelia: I came over here to tell Buffy to stop this craziness, and found
  you all unconscious--again. How many times have you been knocked out,
  anyway? I swear, one of these times, you're going to wake up in a coma.
Giles: Wake up in a...? Oh, never mind. We need to save Buffy from Hansel
  and Gretel.
Cordelia: Now, let's be clear. The brain damage happened before I hit you.
%
Buffy: Okay, that was too close for comfort. Not that slaying is ever
  comfy, but... you know what I mean.
%
Giles: It's a trick. They get inside my head, make me see things I want.
Xander: Then why would they make you see me?
Giles: You're right. Let's go.
%
Buffy: You know, you could have brought that up to us before we did it.
Giles: I did! I said there could be dire consequences.
Buffy: Yes, but you say that about chewing too fast.
%
Xander: Isn't that what they called The Slayer?
Willow: Buffy, ohh scary.
Xander: Someone has to talk to her people. That name is striking fear in
  nobody's hearts.
%
Riley: When I'm around you Buffy I find myself needing to know the plural
  of apocalypse.
%
Jenny: You're here again? You kids really dig the library don't you? 
Buffy: We're literary.
Xander: To read makes our speaking English good.
%
Buffy: We saved the world. I say we have to party.
%
Spike: If every vampire who said he was at the Crucifixion was actually
  there it would've been like Woodstock. I was at Woodstock. I fed off a
  flower person and I spent six hours watching my hand move.
%
Xander: This is just too much. I mean, yesterday's my life like, uh oh, pop
  quiz. Today, it's rain of toads.
%
Joyce: You belong in a good old fashioned college with keg parties and
  boys. Not here with Hellmouths and vampires.
Buffy: Not really seeing the distinction.
%
Gunn: Fair Cordelia. You still savin' my life?
Cordelia: Every minute.
Gunn: How's that workin' out?
Cordelia: You're alive aren't you?
%
Buffy: So, something ripped him open and ate out his insides.
Willow: Like an Oreo cookie. Well, except for, you know, without the
  chocolatey cookie goodness.
%
Xander: I wish dating was like slaying. You know, simple, direct, stake
  through the heart, no muss, no fuss.
%
Spike: Oh, sod the spell. Your friends are in the factory. I'm really glad
  I came here, you know? I've been all wrongheaded about this. weepin',
  crawlin', blamin' everybody else. I want Dru back. I've just gotta be the
  man I was, The man She loved. I'm going to do what I should have done in
  the first place-- I'll find here, wherever she is, tie her up, torture
  her until she likes me again.
%
Buffy: Does it ever get easy?
Giles: You mean life?
Buffy: Yeah, does it ever get easy?
Giles: What do you want me to say?
Buffy: Lie to me.
Giles: Yes. It's terribly simple. The good guys are always s talwart and
  true. The bad guys are easily distinguished by their pointy horns or
  black hats, and we always defeat them and save the day. No one ever
  dies... and everyone lives happily ever after.
Buffy: Liar.
%
Spike: I did a couple of slayers in my time. I don't like to brag. Who am I
  kidding? I love to brag. One time, during the Boxer Rebellion...
%
Cordelia: Do you know what he's going to do to me when he finds out I let
  his car get stolen? I mean, what are the chances that a vampire has full
  insurance with a low deductible?
%
Willy: What are you gonna' do with him, anyway?
Spike: I'm thinkin' maybe dinner and a movie. I don't want to rush into
  anything. I've been hurt, you know.
%
Xander: Generally speaking, when scary things get scared, not good. 
%
Anya: Men like sports. I'm sure of it.
Xander: Yes. Men like sports. Men watch the action movie, they eat of the
  beef, and they enjoy to look at the bosoms. A thousand years of avenging
  our wrongs, and that's all you've learned?
%
Oz: Looks dead, smells dead, yet it's moving around. That's interesting. 
%
Buffy: I don't wanna' bug Giles. He's still kinda' twitchy when it comes to
  the subject of Angel.
Xander: Oh, it must be that whole 'Angel killed his girlfriend and tortured
  him' thing, and Giles is petty when it comes to stuff like that.
%
Buffy: What are you doing here, Spike? Five words or less!
Spike: (counting on fingers) Out... for... a... walk... bitch.
%
Angel: It's complicated how this all happened, Buffy, you know. It's kind
  of a long story.
Buffy: Your new sidekick had a vision, I was in it, you came to Sunnydale?
Angel: Okay, maybe not that long.
%
Buffy: Then why with the crazy?
Riley: Because I'm so in love with you I can't think straight.
%
Drusilla: How do you feel about eternal life?
Xander: We couldn't just start with coffee?
%
Buffy: I can't put it off any longer. I have to meet my terrible fate. 
Giles: What?
Buffy: Biology.
%
Xander: Just because you're better than us doesn't mean you can be all
  superior.
%
Xander: Well, I guess that makes it official. Everybody's paired off.
  Vampires get dates. Hell, even the school librarian sees more action than
  me.
%
Xander: What's going on here? People are going all Felicity with their
  hair.
%
Spike: I would, but I'm paralyzed with not caring very much.
%
Wesley: Back, creature of the night! Leave this place!
Evil Willow: Don't wanna.
Wesley: (threatens with holy water)
Evil Willow: (sighs) Whatever.
%
Spike: Nasty sort of fellow. Lucky for you blighters I was here, eh?
Giles: Yes. Thank you. Although your heroism is slightly muted by the fact
  that you were helping Adam to start a war that would kill us all.
Xander: You probably just saved us so we wouldn't stake you right here.
Spike: Well, yeah. Did it work?
%
Angel: This isn't some fairy tale. When I kiss you... you don't wake up
  from a deep sleep and live happily ever after.
Buffy: No... when you kiss me, I wanna die.
%
Cordelia: You're really campaigning for bitch of the year, aren't you? 
Buffy: As defending champion, you nervous?
Cordelia: I can hold my own.
%
Willow: Why couldn't he be possessed by a puppy, or some ducks? 
%
Buffy: Hey, I know! Why don't you kill them?
Giles: I'm a Watcher, I haven't the skill.
Buffy: Oh, come on. A stake through the heart, a little sunlight. It's like
  falling off a log.
%
Giles: (scoffs) Magic! Magic's all balderdash and chicanery. I'm afraid we
  don't know a bloody thing. (everyone looking at him) Except I seem to be
  British, don't I? Uh, and a man. With ... glasses. (removes glasses)
  Well, that narrows it down considerably.
%
Willow: Everything seems normal. Not a snake, not a wasp.
Cordelia: Yup. School can open tomorrow.
Xander: Explain to me again how that's a good thing?
Cordelia: I'm drawing a blank.
%
Buffy: I gotta stop him before he unleashes unholy havoc and it's just
  another Tuesday night in Sunnydale.
%
Angel: Buffy.
Buffy: Angel.
Xander: Xander.
%
Spike: What's this? Sittin' around watching the telly while there's evil
  still afoot? It's not very industrious of you. I say we go out there and
  kick a little demon ass! What, can't go without your Buffy, is that it?
  Let's find her! She is the chosen one, after all. Come on! Vampires!
  Grrr! Nasty! Let's annihilate them, for justice, and for... the safety of
  puppies... and Christmas, right? Let's fight that evil! Let's kill
  something! Oh, come on!
%
%
Oz: Sometimes when I'm sitting in class...you know, I'm not thinking about
  class 'cause that would never happen... I think about kissing you. And
  it's like everything stops, it's like,
  freeze frame: Willow kissage.
%
Buffy: Cool. You guys can do the brain thing. I'm gonna go to class. 
Oz: Which could also be construed as the brain thing.
%
Angel: Buffy, careful with this gift. Lots of things that seem strong and
  good and powerful, they can be painful.
Buffy: Like, say, immortality?
Angel: Exactly. I'm dying to get rid of that.
Buffy: Funny.
Angel: I'm a funny guy.
%
Spike: We like to talk big... vampires do. 'I'm going to destroy the
  world.' That's just tough-guy talk. Strutting around with your friends
  over a pint of blood. The truth is, I _like_ this world. You've got...dog
  racing, Manchester United. And you've got people. Billions of people
  walking around like Happy Meals with legs. It's all right here. But then
  someone comes along with a vision. With a real... passion for
  destruction. Angel could pull it off. Good-bye, Picadilly. Farewell,
  Leicester-bloody-Square.
%
Cordelia: Hi! You having fun?
Angel: Sure. This is, uh...
Cordelia: Your idea of hell.
Angel: Actually, in hell you tend to know a lot of the people
%
Anya: I swear, I am just trying to find my necklace.
Willow: Well, did you try looking inside the sofa in hell?
%
Colonel: Every inch of this installation is under constant, 24-hour
  surveillance.
Willow: Including the secret lab?
Colonel: Everything! (pause) What secret lab?
%
Angelus: I wanna torture you. I used to love it, and it's been such a long
  time. I mean, the last time I tortured someone, they didn't even *have*
  chainsaws.
%
Angel: I've been around death before. A lot. I've lost people. I've killed
  people...
Cordelia: And you are dead.
%
Buffy: I lost a friend tonight and I may lose more! The whole world may be
  sucked into hell, and you want my help 'cause your girlfriend's a big
  ho?! Let me take this opportunity to NOT care!
%
Principal Snyder: A lot of educators tell students, 'Think of your
  principal as your pal', I say, 'Think of me as your judge, jury, and
  executioner.'
%
Buffy: No, but, see, Mom, that doesn't really work for me. We're just going
  to the magic shop, no school supplies there.
Dawn: Yeah, Mom. I'm not going to Hogwarts. (chuckles) Hog- (looks at
  Buffy, who's not amused) Jeez, crack a book sometime.
%
Spike: Do I have anyone on watch here? It's called security, people. Are
  you all asleep? Or did we finally find a restaurant that delivers?
Ford: I know who you are.
Spike: Yeah, I know who I am too, so what?
%
Buffy: You're missing the whole point of Halloween.
Willow: Free candy?!
%
Riley: I thought maybe we could have a little spread. Sandwiches, maybe
  some ants. Could be fun.
Buffy: We were talking about a picnic?
Riley: Oh... so, was that a conversation I actually had or one I was just
  practicing?
%
Xander: I'm not worried. If there's something bad out there, we'll find,
  you'll slay, we'll party.
%
Mayor Wilkins: There's more than one way to skin a cat. And I happen to
  know that factually that's true.
%
Oz: So, do you steal weapons from the Army often?
Willow: Well, we don't get cable, so we have to make our own fun.
%
Xander: Yep, vampires are real. A lot of 'em live in Sunnydale. Willow'll
  fill you in.
Willow: I know it's hard to accept at first.
Oz: Actually, it explains a lot.
%
Xander: She must be right. We must have some kind of amnesia.
Buffy: I don't know what that is, but I'm certain I don't have it. I bathe
  quite often.
%
Willow: You're thinking too much. Maybe you need to be impulsive.
Buffy: Impulsive? Do you remember my ex-boyfriend? The vampire? I slept
  with him, he lost his soul, and now my boyfriend's gone forever and the
  demon that wears his face is killing my friends. The next impulsive
  decision I make will be my choice of dentures.
Willow: Okay. The Angel thing went badly. I'm on board with that.
%
Giles: You never train with me anymore. He's gonna kick your ass.
%
Willow: I just talked to Buffy, and yeah, I think she's feeling a little...
  insane. No, not bitchy crazy, more like homicidal maniac crazy. So I told
  her to come see you, 'kay?
%
Spike: We're out of Wheat-a-Bix.
Giles: We are out of Wheat-a-Bix because you ate it all. Again.
Spike: Get some more.
Giles: I thought vampires were supposed to eat blood.
Spike: Yeah, well, sometimes I like to crumble up the Wheat-a-Bix in the
  blood. Gives it a little texture.
Giles: Since the picture you just painted means that I will never touch
  food of any kind again, you'll just have to pick it up yourself.
Spike: Sissy.
%
Maggie Walsh: We use the latest in scientific technology and state-of-the-
  art weaponry, and you, if I understand correctly, poke them with a sharp
  stick.
%
Spike: What's Big Blue doing anyway?
The Judge: I am preparing.
Spike: It's interesting to me that preparing looks a great bit like sitting
  on your ass.
%
Willow: The school paper is edging on depressing lately. Have you guys
  noticed that?
Oz: I don't know. I always go straight to the obits.
%
Willow: Oz is a werewolf.
Buffy: It's a long story.
Oz: Got bit.
Buffy: But obviously not that long.
%
Giles: What are you doing?
Willow: Oh. Sorry. The reflection thing that you don't have...Angel, how do
  you shave?
%
Willow: I don't care if it is an orgy of death, there's still such a thing
  as a napkin.
%
Willow: It's horrible. That's me as a vampire? I'm so evil, and skanky. And
  I think I'm kind of gay.
Buffy: Willow, just remember, a vampire's personality has nothing to do
  with the person it was.
Angel: Well, actually... That's a good point.
%
Giles: Alright. I'll just jump into my time machine, go back to the 12th
  century and ask the vampires to postpone their ancient prophecy for a few
  days while you take in dinner and a show.
Buffy: Okay, at this point you're abusing sarcasm.
%
Angel: Acathla turned to stone, as demons sometimes do, and was buried
  where neither man nor demon would want to look...unless, of course,
  they're putting up low-rent housing.
%
Anya: What a day. Gimme a beer.
Bartender: (deadpan) ID. (Anya glares at him.) 
Bartender: (deadpan) ID.
Anya: I'm eleven hundred and twenty years old! Just gimme a frickin' beer! 
Bartender: (deadpan) ID.
Anya: (sigh) Gimme a Coke.
%
Wicca girl: We come together, daughters of Gaia, sisters to the moon. We
  walk with the darkness, the wolf at our side. Through the waterfall of
  power, to the blackest heart of eternity. I think we should have a bake
  sale.
%
Wesley: I can't tell you how sorry I am that I allowed this to happen.
Cordelia: I believe it was Faith who allowed her elbow to collide with my
  face.
Wesley: At least you only got the elbow.
Cordelia: Well, if it's any consolation, it looks like you were tortured by
  a much larger woman
%
Spike:'Made with care for Randy.' (looks at Giles angrily) Randy Giles? Why
  not just call me 'Horny Giles,' or 'Desperate for a Shag Giles'? I knew
  there was a reason I hated you!
Giles: Randy's ... a family name, undoubtedly.
%
Faith: Isn't it crazy how slayin' just always makes you hungry and horny?
Buffy: Well... sometimes I crave a nonfat yogurt afterwards.
%
Buffy: Looks like a job for wiccan-girl. What do you say, Will? Big time
  danger.
Willow: Hey, I eat danger for breakfast.
Xander: But, oddly enough, she panics in the face of breakfast foods.
%
Angel: So, you're back.
Cordelia: Very good, Mister I-can't-tail-the-suspect-during-the-day-
  because-I'll-burst-into-flames Private Eye.
%
Riley: Buffy . . . I feel like we've gotten really close. At least I
  thought we had. I don't know much about Angel or your relationship with
  him . . but . . . all I ask is . . if you're gonna break heart, do it
  fast.
Buffy: What? You think that Angel and I...
Riley: Didn't you?
Buffy: No. Of course not. How can you even ask me that?
Riley: I don't know. Xander said...
Buffy: Xander?! Oh, he's the deadest man in Deadonia.
%
Spike: A slayer with family and friends. That sure as hell wasn't in the
  brochure.
%
Spike: I'm bad! It's just I can't bite anymore, thanks to you wankers...
  Bye the bye, if you're trying to kill her... (gives Riley two thumbs up)
%
Xander: I have my pride. Okay, so I don't have a *lot* of my pride, but I
  have enough so that I can't do this.
%
Principal Snyder: There are some things I can just smell. It's like a sixth
  sense.
Giles: No, actually, that would be one of the five.
%
Anya: This isn't a relationship. You don't need me.  All you care about is
  lots of orgasms.
Xander: Okay, remember how we talked about private conversations? How
  they're less private when they're in front of my friends?
Spike: Oh we're not your friends. Go on.
Giles: Please don't
%
Anya: I have witnessed a millennium of treachery and oppression from the
  males of the species, and I have nothing but contempt for the whole
  libidinous lot of them.
Xander: Then why are you talking to me?
Anya: I don't have a date for the prom.
Xander: Well, gosh, I wonder why not? It couldn't possibly have anything to
  do with your sales pitch.
Anya: Men are evil. Will you go with me?
%
Xander: All right, where is he? Where's the creep who turned me into a
  spider-eating man-bitch?
Buffy: He's gone.
Xander: Dammit. You know what? I'm sick of this. I'm tired of being the guy
  who eats insects and gets the funny syphilis. As of this moment, it's
  over. I'm through being everybody's butt-monkey!
Buffy: Check. No more butt-monkey.
%
Xander: It's time for me to act like a man... and hide.
%
Spike: Should I really trust you?
Adam: Scout's honor.
Spike: You were a Boy Scout?
Adam: Parts of me.
%
Spike: Oh, listen to Mary Poppins. He's got his crust all stiff and upper
  with that nancy-boy accent. (everyone looking at him) You Englishmen are
  always so... (pauses) Bloody hell! (ticks off on his fingers) Sodding,
  blimey, shagging, knickers, bollocks, oh God! I'm English!
Giles: Welcome to the nancy tribe.
%
Buffy: Look, I know this new guy's a dork, but... Well, I have nothing to
  follow that. He's pretty much just a dork.
%
Oz: We survived.
Buffy: Yeah, it was some battle.
Oz: I meant high school.
%
Buffy: Believe it or not, Jonathan, I understand about the pain.
Jonathon: Oh, right. 'Cause the burden of being beautiful and athletic,
  that's a crippler.
%
Cordelia: Everything has been taken away because Daddy made a little
  mistake on his taxes... for the last twelve years.
%
Buffy: I didn't say that I'd never slay another vampire. It's not like I
  have all these fluffy bunny feelings for them, I'm just not gonna get way
  extracurricular with it.
%
Mayor Wilkins: I have two words that are going to make all your troubles go
  away. 'Miniature Golf.'
%
Buffy: You know, I just woke up and I looked in the mirror and thought,
  'Hey, what's with all the sin.' I need to change. I'm dirty, I'm bad with
  the sex, and the envy, and the loud music us kids listen to nowadays. Oh,
  I just suck at undercover.
%
Cordelia: What's going on? Oh god, is the world ending? I have to research
  a paper on Bosnia for tomorrow, but if the world's ending, I'm not gonna
  bother.
%
Spike: So when do we destroy the world, already?
%
Giles: But this is why I think we should all keep a level head in this. 
Willow: And I happen to think mine is the level head and yours is the one
  things would roll off of.
%
Xander: Are you ready to get down, you funky party weasel?
%
Anya: You know, you can laugh, but I have witnessed a millennium of
  treachery and oppression from the males of the species, and I have
  nothing but contempt for the whole libidinous lot of them.
Xander: Then why are you talking to me?
Anya: I don't have a date for the prom.
%
Angel: It was a bright afternoon out in front of your school. You walked
  down the steps. And I loved you.
Buffy: Why?
Angel: 'Cause I could see your heart. You held it before you for everyone
  to see. And I worried that it would be bruised or torn. And more than
  anything in my life I wanted to keep it safe, to warm it with my own.
Buffy: That's beautiful. Or taken literally, incredibly gross.
Angel: I was just thinking that, too.
%
Willow: Maybe we shouldn't be too couply around Buffy.
Cordelia: Oh, you mean 'cause of how the only guy that ever liked her
  turned into a vicious killer and had to be put down like a dog?
Xander: Can she cram complex issues into a nutshell or what?
%
Principal Snyder: There are things I will not tolerate: students loitering
  on campus after school, horrible murders with hearts being removed. And
  also smoking.
%
Spike: Willow, tell 'em what I did.
Willow: You said you were gonna kill me, then Buffy.
Spike: Yes, bad, but let's skip that part and get to the part where I
  couldn't bite you.
%
Xander: Hmm, and we thought just because we didn't have any money or any
  place to go, this'd be a lackluster evening.
Willow: I know! We could go to the Bronze, and sneak in our own tea bags
  and ask for hot water.
Xander: Hop off the outlaw train, Will, before you land us all in jail.
%
Buffy: You're a vampire. Oh, I'm sorry. Was that an offensive term? Should
  I say undead American?
%
Xander: Nice. Look who's got a bad case of Dark Prince envy.
Dracula: I have no interest in you. Leave us.
Xander: No, we're not going to (imitates Dracula's accent) leave you. And
  where'd you get that accent Sesame Street? One, two, three - three
  victims. Mwah, ha, ha, ha!
Buffy: Xander, I'm pretty sure that's Dracula.
Xander: Wow, really? Hey, sorry, man, I was... just jokin' around.
%
Spike: You're not friends. You'll never be friends. You'll be in love 'til
  it kills you both. You'll fight, and you'll shag, and you'll hate each
  other 'til it makes you quiver, but you'll never be friends. Real love
  isn't brains, children. It's blood. It's blood screaming inside you to
  work its will. I may be love's bitch, but at least I'm man enough to
  admit it.
%
Wesley: Wait for Faith.
Buffy: That could be hours.  The girl makes Godot look punctual. 
%
Buffy: Have I ever let you down?
Giles: Do you want me to answer that, or shall I just glare?
%
Willow: I'm a bloodsucking fiend! Look at my outfit!
%
Giles: Nothing left but skin and cartilage.
Xander: In other words, this was no boating accident.
%
Xander: Oh. Okay. You and Willow go do the superpower thing, I'll stay
  behind and putt around the Batcave with crusty old Alfred here.
Giles: Ah-ah, no. I am no Alfred, sir. No, you forget. Alfred had a job. 
%
Buffy: Okay, well, how long before you un-crypt it?
Willow: Hours. Days maybe. Anyone suggesting months would not be accused of
  crazy talk.
%
Buffy: Oh, look at my poor neck... all bare and tender and exposed. All
  that blood, just pumping away.
Giles: Oh, please.
Spike: Giles, make her stop!
Giles: If those two don't kill each other, I might lend a hand.
%
Xander: So, Buffy, how'd the slaying go last night?
Buffy: Xander!
Xander: I mean, how'd the laying go? No, I don't mean that either.
%
Buffy: I didn't say you were stupid! So... stop being an idiot and let me
  fix this!
%
Buffy: I told one lie... I had one drink...
Giles: Yes. And you were very nearly devoured by a giant demon snake. The
  words, 'Let that be a lesson' are a tad redundant at this juncture.
%
Miss Calendar: Okay, so this Master guy tried to open the Hellmouth, but he
  got stuck in it.  And now, all the signs are reading that he's going to
  get out, which opens the Hellmouth, which brings the demons which ends
  the world.
Giles: Yes. That about sums it up, yes.
Miss Calendar: The part that gets me, though, is where Buffy is the Vampire
  Slayer. She's so little.
%
Buffy: Do we really need weapons for this?
Spike: I just like them. They make me feel all manly.
%
Xander: You're considered somewhat cool.
Oz: I am?
Xander: Is it because you always tend to express yourself in short, non-
  commital sentences?
Oz: Could be.
%
Ford: I wanna be like you...A vampire.
Spike: I've known you for two minutes and I can't stand you. I don't really
  feature you living forever. Can I eat him now love?
%
Xander: So, do we have to speak Spanish when we see him?' Cause I don't
  know anything much besides 'Doritos' and 'chihuahua.'
%
Giles: Since Angel lost his soul, he's regained his sense of whimsy. 
%
Harmony: How are you gonna kill her? Think! The second you even point that
  thing at her, you're gonna be all 'Aaagh!' (holding her hand to her head
  in imitation of Spike), and then you'll get bitch-slapped up and down
  Main Street, unless she's finally had enough and just stakes you!
Spike: Sure, it'll hurt like hell for about two hours. But she'll be dead
  just a little longer than that.
%
Buffy: Okay, so I battle evil. But I don't really win. The bad keeps coming
  back and getting stronger.  I'm like that kid in the story, the boy that
  stuck his finger in the duck.
Angel: Dike. (Buffy looks at him) It's another word for dam.
Buffy: Oh. Okay,that story makes a lot more sense now.
%
Willow: According to Freddy's latest editorial, 'The pep rally is a place
  for pseudo-prostitutes to provoke men into a sexual frenzy, which, when
  thwarted, results in pointless athletic competition.'
Xander: And the down-side being?
%
Xander: Well, yeah. I'd give anything to be able to turn invisible. I
  wouldn't use my powers to beat people up, but use my powers to protect
  the girl's locker room.
%
Buffy: Mom, the only way you get a new slayer is if the old slayer dies. 
Joyce: Then that means you... When did you die? You never told me you died.
Buffy: It was just for a few minutes.
%
Ford: What happened?
Spike: We're stuck in a basement.
Ford: Buffy?
Spike: She's not stuck in a basement.
%
Buffy: Cool! Crossbow! Check out these babies. Goodbye stakes, hello flying
  fatality.
%
Xander: Dorkhead? You lash me with your words!
%
Cordelia: Oxford. Whoopee. Four years in teabag central. Sounds thrilling.
  And M.I.T. is a clearasil ad with housing, and Yale is a dumping ground
  for those who didn't get into Harvard.
Willow: I got into Harvard.
%
Buffy: Besides, it's kind of my job.
Spike: For now.
Buffy: What, you want me to stop working?
Spike: Well, let's see - do I want you to give up killing my friends? Yeah,
  I've given it some thought.
%
Xander: I don't like vampires. I'm going to take a stand and say they're
  not good.
%
Cordelia: You can't see everything. You're just a vampire like everyone
  else. . . that didn't come out right.
%
Buffy: I'm a great cook... in theory.  I've eaten a lot
%
Giles: In order...to be worthy...you must perform the ritual...in a tutu.
  Pillock!
Angel: All right, someone get the chain saw.
%
Faith: You can't trust guys.
Buffy: You can trust some guys. Really, I've read about them.
%
Buffy: You're like my fairy godmother, and Santa Claus, and Q all wrapped
  up into one. (they look at her) Q from Bond, not Star Trek.
%
Cordelia: When did you become Martha Stewart?
Buffy: First of all, Martha Stewart knows jack about hand-cut prosciutto. 
Xander: I don't believe she slays, either.
Oz: Oh, I hear she can, but she doesn't like to.
%
Angel: Oz.
Oz: Angel.
Angel: Nice surprise.
Oz: Thanks.
Angel: Staying long?
Oz: Few days.
Doyle: They always like this?
Oz: No, we're usually laconic.
%
Buffy: Willow, you're alive.
Willow: Aren't I usually?
%
Buffy: Do---do you think I chose to be like this? Do you have any idea how
  lonely it is, how dangerous? I would love to be upstairs watching TV or
  gossiping about boys or... God, even studying! But I have to save the
  world. Again.
%
Buffy: Now, we can do this the hard way or... well, actually, there's just
  the hard way.
Darla: That's fine with me.
Buffy: Are you sure? Now this is not gonna be pretty. We're talking
  violence, strong language, adult content.
%
Oz: It's Willow, she's nearby.
Cordelia: What? You can smell her? She doesn't even wear perfume.
Oz: She's afraid.
Cordelia: Oh my God, is this some sort of residual werewolf thing? This is
  very disturbing.
Oz: I really agree.
%
Buffy: Could I be seeing Billy's asteroid body?
Giles: Astral body, and I don't know.
%
Angelus: You know, I never properly thanked you for sending me to Hell. 
Buffy: No...
Angelus: I'm wondering, where do I start? A card, fruit basket, hmm?
  Evisceration?
%
Giles: I suspect your mother would want to... put it on the refrigerator. 
Buffy: Yeah. She saw these scores and her head spun around and exploded. 
Giles: I've been on the Hellmouth too long, that was metaphorical, yes? 
Buffy: Yes.
%
Xander: What do you feel?
Anya: Upset, afraid of being without you, and a little hungry.
Xander: I meant about the house.
Anya: Oh. Still haunted.
%
Cordelia: I guess you should know since you helped raise that demon that
  killed that guy that time.
Giles: Yes, do bring that up as often as possible.
%
Buffy: Who are you?
Angel: Let's just say, I'm a friend.
Buffy: Yeah, maybe I don't want a friend.
Angel: I didn't say I was yours.
%
Spike: Death is your art. You make it with your hands day after day. That
  final gasp, that look of peace. And part of you is
desperate to know: What's it like? Where does it lead you? And now you see,
  that's the secret. Not the punch you didn't throw or the kicks you didn't
  land. She really wanted it. Every Slayer has a death wish. Even you.
%
Xander: You were looking at my neck.
Angel: What?
Xander: You were checking out my neck, I saw that.
Angel: No, I wasn't.
Xander: Just keep your distance, pal.
Angel: I wasn't looking at your neck.
Xander: I told you to eat before we left.
%
Jonathon: You think I just want attention?
Buffy: No, I think you're up here in a clock tower with a high-powered
  rifle because you want to blend in.
%
Wesley: The Council's orders are to concentrate on the...
Buffy: Orders. I don't think I'm going to be taking any more orders. Not
  from you, not from them.
Wesley: You can't turn your back on the Council.
Buffy: They're in England. I don't think they can tell which way my back is
  facing.
%
Buffy: Angel, do you snore?
Angel: I don't know. It's been a long time since anyone's been in a
  position to let me know.
%
Angel: Donuts?
Wesley: Developed a sweet fang, have you?
%
Joyce: Have we met?
Spike: You hit me with an ax one time. Remember? Uh, 'Get the hell away
  from my daughter!'
Joyce: Oh. So, do you, uh, live here in town?
%
Buffy: Cordelia, your mouth is open, sound is coming from it, this is never
  good.
%
Xander: Hi, for those of you who just tuned in, everyone here is a crazy
  person.
%
Harmony: Is Antonio Banderas a vampire?
Spike:No.
Harmony: Can I make him one?
Spike: No. On second thought, yes. Go make him a vampire. Take your time.
  Get Melanie and the kids, too.
%
Xander: Jeez. You mean Oz just sent for his stuff and didn't even call her?
  That's pretty harsh.
Anya: I only wish I had my powers back. I'd liquefy his entrails for her. 
Xander: That's sweet.
%
Buffy: Oh, no... I have to go take an English make-up exam. They give you
  credit just for speaking it, right?
%
Buffy: Mom, dead people are talking to you. Do the math!
%
Angelus: No weapons... no friends... no hope. Take all that away and what's
  left?
Buffy: Me.
%
Buffy: I don't play well with others.
%
Angel: She murdered a man right in front of me, and I can't even testify to
  that fact in a court of law.
Cordelia: Well, maybe in night court you could...
%
Giles: What ever happened to Latin? At least when that made no sense, the
  church approved.
%
Mayor Wilkins: She's pretty, Angel. A little skinny. Still don't understand
  why it couldn't work out with you and my Faith. I guess you kinda just
  have strange tastes in women.
Angel: Yeah, well, what can I say? I like 'em sane.
%
Buffy: When Giles sends me on a mission, he says 'please.' And afterwards I
  get a cookie.
%
Cordelia: What is stalking nowadays, like, the third most popular sport
  among men?
Angel: Fourth, after luge
%
Angel: You've never done this before. Look, it takes tremendous strength --
  mental strength.
Wesley: Resistence to suggestion. Yes, I understand that. I like to think
  of myself as possessing a certain...
Angel: Wesley, you don't even have sales resistance. How many thigh masters
  do you own?
Wesley: The second one was a free gift with my Buns of Steel.
%
Buffy: You read my diary? That is not OK. A diary is like a person's most
  private possession. You don't even know what I was writing about. Hunk
  can mean a lot of things, bad things. And, and when I said his eyes were
  penetrating, I meant bulging.
Angel: Buffy...
Buffy: A doesn't even stand for Angel for that matter. It stand for Achmed,
  a charming foreign exchange student. And that whole fantasy part has
  nothing to even do with you, at all...
Angel: Your mother moved your diary when she came in to straighten up. I
  watched her from the closet. I didn't read it, I swear.
Buffy: Oh.
%
Xander: Oh, hey, do you want to come to our place for dinner? Mom's making
  her famous phone call to the Chinese place.
Willow: Xander, do you guys even have a stove?
%
Drusilla: Your face is a poem. I can read it.
Xander: It doesn't say 'spare me' by any chance?
%
Willow: On the other hand, maybe Rodney just stepped out for a smoke.
Xander: For twenty-one hours?
Willow: It's addictive, you know.
%
Buffy: We have a marching jazz band?
Oz: Yeah, but, you know, since the best jazz is improvisational, we'd be
  going off in all directions, banging into floats... scary.
Willow: He's just being Oz.
Oz: Pretty much full time.
%
Adam: You failed me.
Spike: Let's not quibble about who failed who.
%
Whistler: Bottom line is, even if you see them coming, you're not ready for
  the big moments. No one asks for their life to change, not really. But it
  does. So, what are we, helpless? Puppets? Nah. The big moments are gonna
  come, you can't help that. It's what you do afterwards that counts.
  That's when you find out who you are.
%
Buffy: Well, that works out great. You won't tell anyone that I'm the
  Slayer, and I won't tell anyone you're a moron.
%
Xander:The mayor is gonna kill us all during graduation.
Cordelia: Oh. Are you gonna go to fifth period?
Xander: I'm thinking I might skip it.
Cordelia: Yeah. Me too.
%
Giles: This one?
Buffy: Amethyst.
Giles: Used for?
Buffy: Breath mints?
Giles: Charm bags, money spells and for cleansing one's aura.
Buffy: Okay, so how do you know if one's aura's dirty? Somebody comes by
  with a finger and writes 'wash me' on it?
%
Buffy: People to see, demons to kill.
%
Xander: The quick draw is about more than speed. It's also about pointing
  the stake the right way. And there can be splinter issues.
%
Cordelia: Buffy, these men are rich, and I am not being shallow. Think of
  all the poor people I could help with all my money.
%
Kendra: I call it Mr. Pointy.
Buffy: You named your stake?
Kendra: Yes.
Buffy: Remind me to get you a stuffed animal.
%
Xander: Yeah, I'm gonna have to go with dead boy on this one.
Angel: Could you not call me that?
%
Buffy: So. You saw their faces, but you can't describe them.
Spike: Well, they were human. Two eyes each, kind of in the middle.
%
Buffy: What should we do with the trio over here? Should we burn them? 
Willow: I brought marshmallows.
%
Xander: So, we Bronzin' it tonight?
Willow: Wednesdays, kinda beat...
Xander: Well, we could grind our enemies into talcum powder with a
  sledgehammer, but, gosh, we did that last night.
%
Cordelia: Oh my god! She killed him! (touches dust) Oops. My bad. It's just
  dust. I forgot to clean under the rug.
Doyle: What are you trying to give me a heart attack?
Cordelia: Hey, don't blame me if he's too cheap to hire a cleaning lady.
%
Cordelia: I do what I want to do. And I wear what I want to wear. And you
  know what, I'll date whoever the hell I want to date... no matter how
  lame he is.
%
Buffy: Will, wait. I'm really sorry.
Willow: Buff, I'm storming off. It doesn't really work if you come with me.
%
Giles: Might I have a word?
Buffy: Have a sentence even.
%
Willow: Diana, Hecate, I hereby license thee to depart. Goddess of
  creatures great and small, I conjure thee to withdraw
Amy: (squeak)
Buffy: Maybe we should get her one of those wheel thingies.
%
Anya: You know this isn't your world, right? I mean, you know you don't
  belong here.
Willow: No. This is a dumb world. On my world, there are people in chains,
  and we can ride them like ponies.
%
Buffy: Your logic does not resemble our Earth logic.
Xander: Mine's much more advanced.
%
Buffy: I can't believe you got into Oxford!
Willow: It's pretty exciting.
Oz: That's some deep academia there.
Buffy: That's where they make Gileses!
Willow: I know! I can learn, and have scones!
%
Anya: For a thousand years I wielded the powers of the Wish. I brought ruin
  to the heads of unfaithful men. I brought forth destruction and chaos for
  the pleasure of the lower beings. I was feared and worshipped across the
  mortal globe. And now I'm stuck at Sunnydale High. Mortal. Child. And I'm
  flunking Math.
%
Willow: I mean, please.  Does Angel come up to Faith's standards for a
  guy? Let's see, is he breathing?
Buffy: Actually, no.
%
Buffy: The world is what it is---we fight, we die. Wishing doesn't change
  that.
Giles: I have to believe in a better world.
Buffy: Go ahead. I have to live in this one.
%
Spike: Ahhhh, my head. I think I'm sobering up. It's horrible. Ah... God...
  I wish I was dead.
%
Willow: Xander, wanna stay and help me?
Xander: Are you kidding?
Willow: Yes, it was a joke I made up.
%
Anya: I know what broke up him and Cordelia, you know. It was you! And your
  lips!
Willow: No, it was not! Well, yes it was so, but... that was a long time
  ago, do you think I'd do that again?
Anya: Why not?
Willow: Hello? Gay now!
%
Spike: Whatcha doin', love?
Drusilla: I'm naming the stars.
Spike: You can't see the stars, love. That's the ceiling. Also it's day. 
Drusilla: No, I can see them. But I've named them all the same name, and
  there's terrible confusion.
%
Buffy: It was exactly you, Will. Every detail. Except for your not being a
  dominatrix... as far as we know.
Willow: Oh, right, me and Oz play Mistress of Pain every night.
Xander: Did anyone else just go to a scary visual place?
Buffy: Oh, yeah.
Giles: (raises glasses)
%
Joyce: But maybe, we could spend some time together soon? Some night when
  I'm not being held hostage by a raving psychotic.
%
Xander: How could you let her go?
Giles: As the soon-to-be-purple area on my jaw will attest, I did not 'let'
  her go.
%
Willow: So, how did it go?
Xander: On a scale from one to ten? It sucked.
%
Cordelia: If the world doesn't end, I'm gonna need a note.
%
Giles: I'll have you know that I have very, um, many relaxing hobbies.
Buffy: Such as?
Giles: Well, um...I enjoy cross-referencing.
Buffy: Do you stuff your own shirts or do you send 'em out?
%
Buffy: I wish we could be regular kids.
Angel: I'll never be a kid.
Buffy: Okay then, a regular kid and her cradle-robbing creature-of-the-
  night boyfriend.
%
Giles: Demons after money.  Whatever happened to the still-beating heart
  of a virgin?  No one has any standards anymore.
%
Angelus: 'Dear Buffy...' Hmmm. I'm still trying to decide the best way to
  send my regards.
Spike: Why don't you rip her lungs out? That might make an impression. 
Angelus: Lacks... poetry.
Spike: Doesn't have to. What rhymes with lungs?
%
Xander: And they say that young people don't learn anything in high school
  nowadays, but I've learned to be afraid.
%
Buffy: See, this is a school. And we have students and they check out books
  and then they learn things.
Giles: I was beginning to suspect that was a myth.
%
Faith: When I'm fighting, it's like the whole world goes
away. I only know one thing: that I'm gonna win, and they're gonna lose. I
  like that feeling.
Buffy: Well sure, beats that 'dead' feeling you get when they win and you
  lose.
%
Anyanka: You trusting fool. How do you know the other world is any better
  than this?
Giles: Because it has to be.
%
Buffy: I'm gonna give you all a nice, fun, normal evening if I have to kill
  every person on the face of the Earth to do it.
%
Xander: And this...is called a snack food.
Ampata: Snack food?
Xander: Yeah. It's a delicious, spongy, golden cake stuffed with a
  delightful, creamy white substance of goodness.
Xander: And the exciting part is that they have no ingredients that a human
  can pronounce, so it doesn't leave you with that heavy food feeling in
  your stomach.
%
Cordelia: You're just a souless bloodsucking demon. They're LAWYERS
%
Joyce: Something's gonna eat those babies?
Principal Snyder: I think that is so wrong.
%
Anya: Listen, I have this little project I'm working on, and I heard you
  were the person to ask if...
Willow: Yeah, that's me. Reliable dog-geyser-person.
%
Harmony: Why have you come to our lonely, small town, which has no post
  office and very few exports?
%
Spike: It's a big rock. Can't wait to tell my friends. They don't have a
  rock this big.
%
Buffy: I'm sorry, it's just been a really weird day.
Xander: Yeah, Buffy died and everything.
Willow: Wow, harsh.
%
Buffy: You sound like Mr. Initiative! 'Demons bad, people good.' 
Riley: Something wrong with that theorem?
%
Angel: I'm weak. I've never been anything else. I wanted to lose myself in
  you. I know it will cost me my soul, and part of me didn't care. It's not
  the demon in me that needs killing, Buffy, it's the man.
%
Xander: Calm may work for Locutus of the Borg here, but I'm freaked out,
  and I intend to stay that way.
%
Willow: Oz is a werewolf.
Buffy: It's a long story.
Oz: I got bit.
Buffy: Apparently not that long.
Faith: Hey, as long as you don't go scratchin' at me or humpin' my leg,
  we're five-by-five, ya' know?
Oz: Fair enough.
%
Buffy: It's weird, though. In this way, I feel like he's still watching me.
Willow: Well, in a way he sort of is...in the way of that he's right over
  there.
%
Buffy: Do you remember that demon that almost got out the night I died? 
Willow: Every nightmare I have that doesn't revolve around academic failure
  or public nudity is about that thing. In fact, once I dreamt that it
  attacked me while I was late for a test and naked.
%
Willow: I knew it! I knew it! Well, not in the sense of having the
  slightest idea, but I knew there was something I didn't know.
%
Spike: Where have you been pet?
Drusilla: I went for a walk. I met an old man. I didn't like him, he got
  stuck in my teeth.
%
Xander: We're right behind you, only further back.
%
Angel: I knew this was gonna happen.
Buffy: What? What do you think is happening?
Angel: You're 16 years old, I'm 241.
Buffy: I've done the math.
Angel: You don't know what you're doing. You don't know what you want. 
Buffy: Oh, no. I think I do. I want out of this conversation.
%
Riley: Way I heard it. You were all peaceable now. You didn't by any chance
  go and lose that pesky soul again, did you?
Angel: Don't push me, boy.
Riley: Now what possibly could've happened with Buffy that would make you
  lose your soul?
Angel: That'd be between me and her.
Riley: Where do you think you're going?
Angel: Going to see an old girlfriend.
%
Buffy: Are you crazy? You just don't sneak up on people in a graveyard. You
  make noise when you walk, you stomp, or... yodel.
%
Willow: Old reliable? Yeah, great. There's a sexy nickname.
Buffy: Well, I didn't mean it as...
Willow: No, it's fine, I'm Old Reliable.
Xander: She just means, you know, the geyser. You're like a geyser of fun
  that goes off at regular intervals.
Willow: That's Old Faithful.
Xander: Isn't that the dog that the guy had to shoot...?
Willow: That's Old Yeller.
Buffy: Xander, I beg you not to help me.
%
Cordelia: What's her saga?
Xander: She's freaking.
Cordelia: About what?
Xander: The mayor is gonna kill us all during graduation.
Cordelia: Oh. Are you gonna go to 5th period?
%
Xander: I don't get your crazy system!
Giles: It's called the alphabet.
Xander: Would ya look at that.
%
Xander: Dinner is served. And my very own recipe.
Willow: Ooh, you pushed the button on the microwave that says 'popcorn'?
Xander: Actually, I pushed 'defrost', but Joyce was there in the clinch.
%
Cordelia: We were just discussing whether or not we should offer to pay
  Gunn.
Angel: No you weren't.
Wesley: Well, our discussions tend to go about 3 minutes, then it's
  strictly name calling and hair pulling.
%
Buffy: I didn't jump to conclusions. I took a small step, and conclusions
  there were.
%
Willow: The only solution is the final solution.
Xander: Nuke the school? I like that.
Willow: Not quite. Exorcism.
Cordelia: Are you crazy? I saw that movie. Even the priest died.
%
Buffy: She's playing you. She tried to kill you.
Angel: That was just. . . That was just a cry for help.
Buffy: A cry for help is when you say Help in a loud voice.
%
The Master: You were destined to die, it was written.
Buffy: What can I say? I flunked the written.
%
Buffy: I told you. I said end of the world. And you're like, 'Pooh-pooh,
  Southern California, pooh-pooh.'
Giles: I'm so very sorry. My contrition completely dwarfs the impending
  apocalypse.
%
Xander: I laugh in the face of danger.  Then I hide until it goes away
%
Xander: Cavalry's here! Cavalry's a scared guy with a club, but it's here! 
%
Buffy: Ahh, it's okay. Gave Cord and I chance to spend some quality death
  time.
Cordelia: And we got these free corsages.
%
Angel: The Master arose. He let me live... to punish me. I kept hoping
  you'd come. My destiny...
Buffy: Is this a get-in-my-pants thing? You guys in Sunnydale talk like I'm
  the second coming.
%
Buffy: Every time you show up like this, you risk all your parts, you know
  that?
Spike: I wouldn't be here if I didn't have a good reason. As usual, I'm
  here to help you and I... are you naked under there?
Buffy: Get out.
Spike: No, I'm serious. I mean, not about the naked part...
%
Dracula: Very impressive hunt. Such power.
Buffy: That was no hunt. That was just another day on the job. Care to step
  up for some overtime?
Dracula: We're not going to fight.
Buffy: Do you know what a Slayer is?
Dracula: Do you?
Buffy: Who are you?
Dracula: I apologize. I assumed you knew. I am Dracula.
Buffy: Get out!
%
Willow: You just don't like him 'cause of that time he beat you up every
  day for five years.
Xander: Yeah, I'm irrational that way.
%
Buffy: You know, for someone who teaches human behavior, you might try
  showing some.
Professor Walsh:It's not my job to coddle my students.
Buffy: You're right. A human being in pain has nothing to do with your job.
  (leaves)
Professor Walsh: I like her.
Riley: Really? You don't think she's a little peculiar?
%
Giles: I need you to take Spike for a few days.
Xander: What?
Spike: What?
Anya: What?
Spike: I'm not stayin' with him.
Giles: I have a friend who's coming to town, and I'd like us to be alone. 
Anya: Oh, you mean an orgasm friend?
Giles: Yes, that's exactly the most appalling thing you could have said. 
%
Buffy: Ampata wasn't evil. At least, not to begin with. And...I do think
  she cared about you.
Xander: Yeah, but I think that whole sucking the life out of people thing
  would've been a strain on the relationship.
%
Xander: I still don't know why we had to come here to look up information
  on a killer snot monster.
Giles: Because it's a killer snot monster from outer space. ...I did not
  say that.
%
Buffy: Vampires are creeps.
Giles: Yes. That's why one slays them.
%
Buffy: What do you want?
Spike: I told you. I want to stop Angel. I want to save the world.
Buffy: Okay, you do remember that you're a vampire, right?
Spike: We like to talk big... vampires do. I'm going to destroy the world.
  That's just tough-guy talk. Strutting around with your friends over a
  pint of blood. The truth is, I _like_ this world. You've got...dog
  racing, Manchester United. And you've got people. Billions of people
  walking around like Happy Meals with legs. It's all right here. But then
  someone comes along with a vision. With a real... passion for
  destruction. Angel could pull it off. Good-bye, Picadilly. Farewell,
  Leicester-bloody-Square.
%
Spike: You won. Alright?  You came in and you killed them, and you took
  their land.  That's what conquering nations do.  It's what Caeser did,
  and he's not going around saying I came, I conquered, I felt really bad
  about it.
%
Forrest: This is the burden we bear, brother. We have a gig that would
  inevitably cause any girl living to think we are cool upon cool. Yet, we
  must Clark Kent our way through the dating scene, never to use our unfair
  advantage. Thank God we're pretty.
%
Xander: I can not stress enough how much I don't have plans.
%
Willow: Nervous?
Xander: No way. I'm full of that good old kamikazee spirit.
Giles: Xander, just because this is never going to work, there's no need to
  be negative.
%
Spike: What, your Mom doesn't know?
Joyce: Know what?
Buffy: That I'm, uh...in a band. A rock band...with Spike here.
Spike: Right. She plays the-the triangle...
Buffy: Drums.
Spike: Drums, yeah. She's hell on the old skins, you know.
Joyce: (to Spike) And what do you do?
Spike: Well I sing.
%
Buffy: What do you want?
Angel: The same thing you do.
Buffy: Okay. What do I want?
Angel: To kill 'em. To kill 'em all.
Buffy: Sorry, that's incorrect. But, you do get this watch and a year's
  supply of turtle wax. What I want is to be left alone.
%
Xander: The band, yeah. They're great. They march.
Willow: Like an army. Except with music, instead of bullets, and usually no
  one dies.
%
Spike (watching, from a distance, a conversation between Angel and a woman
he just rescued):

  Woman: How can I thank you, you mysterious 'black clad hunk of a knight
    thing'?
  Angel: No need little lady. Your tears of gratitude are enough for me. You
    see, I was once a bad-ass vampire. But love, and a pesky curse,
    defanged me. And now, I'm just a *big* fluffy puppy with bad teeth.
    No! Not the hair! Never the hair. 
  Woman: But there must be some way I can show my appreciation. 
  Angel: No, helping those in need's my job. And working up a load of sexual
    tension and prancing away like a magnificent poof is truly thanks enough. 
  Woman: I understand. I have a nephew who's gay, so... 
  Angel: Say no more. Evil's still afoot. And I'm almost out of that Nancy-boy
    hair gel I like so much. Quickly! To the Angel-mobile! Away!
%
Angel: It was a bright afternoon out in front of your school. You walked
  down the steps. And I loved you.
Buffy: Why?
Angel: Cause I could see your heart. You held it before you for everyone
  to see. And I worried that it would be bruised or torn. And more than
  anything in my life I wanted to keep it safe, to warm it with my own.
Buffy: That's beautiful. Or taken literally, incredibly gross.
Angel: I was just thinking that, too.
%
Buffy: It was exactly you, Will. Every detail. Except for your not being
  a dominatrix... as far as we know.
Willow: Oh, right, me and Oz play Mistress of Pain every night.
Xander: Did anyone else just go to a scary visual place?
Buffy: Oh, yeah.
Giles: (raises glasses)
%
Buffy: She's playing you. She tried to kill you.
Angel: That was just. . . That was just a cry for help.
Buffy: A cry for help is when you say 'Help' in a loud voice.
%
Xander: Okay, this is starting to grate my cheese.  These
  woods aren't that big. Now, I know we've beein going straight because
